1. User joins server with bot running
2. Bot welcomes the user and suggests the investing feature .invest
3. User types .invest -> user's id is recorded by the bot and compared to a dictionary with all registered users (users who have used .invest feature before)
{The dictionary is populated everytime the bot is starting or a new user joins, the dictionary with ids and their associated purchases is stored via CockroachDB}
4. If user is new, bot messages the commands, and informs the user of 100k of fake money deposited into his account
5. If user is regular, bot welcomes the user back into the trading platform and showcases their portfolio (how much cash they have and any stocks they own)
6. User can then issue a series of commands (.buy, .sell, .portfolio, .exit, .help)

.buy: bot informs the user that he has to input the Ticker (TSLA for example)
-> the bot then calculates how much you can buy -> max buy 13.5 shares (for example) 
-> user can then type a number for the amount of shares or type anything else to leave the buying menu
